# Ecuadorian Food Image Classifier üçΩÔ∏èüá™üá®

This project trains a convolutional neural network (CNN) using TensorFlow to classify images of traditional Ecuadorian food.

## Overview
The dataset was custom-made and uploaded to Kaggle. It includes classes like:
- Bol√≥n
- Ceviche
- Encebollado
- ...

We use image preprocessing, data validation, and CNN model training to build a food classifier.

## Technologies
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Google Colab
- Kaggle API
- NumPy, Matplotlib

## How to Run
1. Clone the repo or open the notebook in Google Colab:
   [![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](YOUR_COLAB_LINK_HERE)
2. Make sure to upload your Kaggle API key (`kaggle.json`)
3. Run all cells to download the dataset, preprocess it, train the model, and view results.

## Results
- Accuracy: ~XX% (adjust based on your actual results)
- Model: Sequential CNN with 3 convolutional layers
